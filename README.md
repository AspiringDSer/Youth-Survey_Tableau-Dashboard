# Motivation <a name='Motivation'></a>
There is an ever growing need to effectively clean and analyze customer data. Surveys is one form of a customer data source. I have taken a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey) that contains youth questionnarie information and preprocessed it. Next, I made a Tableau Dashboard visualize the cleaned data.

Note: I have attached the Tableau Workbook, so one can view the Dashboard in the Workbook as well.

## API 

![Uploading Dataset to S3](./images/local_awscli_s3.PNG)
In attempt to mimic real-life datasets, I have uploaded the Youth Survey Dataset to a s3 bucket `jmah-public-data`. Instead of downloading CSV files and read from local, we will read the data directly from the Cloud. This also allows Users to easily create copies of the datasets. I have created a [custom-build class](https://github.com/AspiringDSer/Youth-Survey_Tableau-Dashboard/blob/master/youth_survey/getsurvey.py) called `Survey` to manipulate our data. 

## Data Wrangling 

I used Python to clean the data. You can find the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AspiringDSer/Youth-Survey_Tableau-Dashboard/blob/master/EDA/survey-EDA.ipynb) in the EDA folder. I needed to create a completely new dataframe in order to allow Tableau to visual the data. Once the data was preprocessed, I exported it into CSV file, `survey.csv`.  

## Tableau Dashboard

As you can see from the [image](#About-the-Project) above, the Dashboard has the ability to filter various features: Questionnaire Set, Gender, and Age (bins). Participants choose from a range from 1 to 5. 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree. The cleaned dataset has other features that the Dashboard can filter on, however, I will implement those filters in the future. 

# Future Developments <a name='Future'></a>
The Survey Dashboard Project still needs further refinement. I plan continue development in these areas:

* Change Float Answers to Integers 
* Adding More Filters to Dashboard
* Add Participant Counter to Dashboard
